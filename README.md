Casserole is a GUI tool for managing and monitoring Cassandra clusters.  It is
written in Java and forms generated by JFormDesigner (not needed to run).

## Building

build everything with `ant dist`

## Running

If you build the `dist` target, you can just double-click on cassandra-casserole.jar.
If you want to do things the hard way, the main class is `org.apache.cassandra.casserole.Main`.
