# Casserole

Casserole is a GUI tool for managing and monitoring Cassandra clusters.  It is
written in Java and forms generated by JFormDesigner (not needed to run).

## License

Assume Apache License, Vesion 2.0 for now.

## Building

compile with `ant build`

build everything with `ant dist`

## Running

There are several ways you can run Casserole

1. `ant build dist` and double-click on `dist/cassandra-casserole.jar`.
2. `ant run`
3. If you're a masochist, the main class is `casserole.Main`.

If you're interested in hosting a webstart version on your server, there is a jnlp file included in the project root.
It works for me and is probably a good place for you to start if you are interested in deploying casserole that way.

## Caveats

1. Casserole assumes every node in your cluster uses the same JMX port.  If this isn't the case, you should think about
   bending casserole.JmxPortResolver to do your bidding, and use the JVM arg "-Dfutzjmx".
2. I've used JFormDesigner (not free) to create the UI.  The runtime is redistributable though 
   (see license/jgoogies-license.txt).

## Pitch In!

This tool currently sucks. There are plenty of improvements to be made. Please feel free to scratch your own itch or
tackle something in TODO.txt and then send me a pull request.
